    <h2>This is my about me section!</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, my name is Leon Wilke and I'm a Grand Circus bootcamp student in the c# AfterHours program.
        I already have a Bachelors degree in Marketing but after coming to a stalemate in growing my career I decided it was time to dive into coding and grow my skill set.
        Below you will find links to my LinkedIn and GitHub, as well as my email address if you would like to get in contact or follow along with my journey!
